# üèôÔ∏è Population Distribution in Buildings Based on BGRI Data

This repository contains scripts and data files for estimating and visualizing the distribution of the elderly population (65+) in buildings, based on BGRI statistical subsections in Porto, Portugal. The project uses Python libraries such as GeoPandas, Folium, and OSMnx for spatial analysis and visualization.

## üìå Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:

- Analyze the spatial distribution of the elderly population (65+) in buildings.
- Compute population estimates per building using BGRI statistical data.
- Distribute the population proportionally to building footprint area.
- Generate an interactive **Folium** map showing the estimated 65+ population per building.
